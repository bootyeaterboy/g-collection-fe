## Running the app locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Install extensions for the IDE of your choice:
   - Prettier
   - ESLint
   - Tailwind
   - Angular Language Service
4. Run `npm install` in the project directory.
5. Run `npm start` in the project directory.

7. Log in to the app using your ipt account.
8. Code away!

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
