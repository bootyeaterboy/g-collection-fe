# G-Collection FE

Thanks for contributing to the Genius Collection 2.0 app!

## Running the app in a Dev Container

1. Install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Open this project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Install the VS Code extension _Dev Containers_.
4. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
5. Run _Dev Containers: Rebuild Container_.
6. In the terminal of the Dev Container execute `npm start`.
7. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
8. Log in to the app using your ipt account.
9. Code away!

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
